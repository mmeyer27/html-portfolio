<h1>TheBest Movies According to Meg</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars: A New Hope</h3>
<p>This is the one that started it all! So innovative
   and ahead of its time. Plus, a fun story, and great 
   characters!</p>
 <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
 <p>Who doesn't love Indiana Jones? And Marion? 
   And a wholloping great adventure?<br /> This is one
   of the few movies that made me research the bible to
   read about the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
 <h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
 <p>Talk about classics! The story is wonderful. But the most
   important element is Julie Andrews! She is an amazing actress
   and singer! And all the child actors were also great!</p>
